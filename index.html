    <li> Years later, Caitlin left the Navy. Something had been lacking, she missed her autonomy and creative outlets. Massage therapy seemed like an appealing life change. Creative, loving and challenging.
    <li> Caitlin fell in love with Massage therapy.</li>
    <li> But, even that wasn't enough. Caitlin now missed the technical and working in a cooperative environment. She was also worried about her long term future as a massage therapist.</li>
